# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). It is simple but mighty. This project was completed in week 3 of Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp. Many thanks to every mentor who helped along the way, especially Andy, Tausif, and Nem!
